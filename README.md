# Time-Series-Analysis
* In this task we are going to predict the **Opening** price of stocks for the which the **market cap** is over **2 Billion** using deep learning models.
* For this task ,the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used.
* CNN is better than LSTM and RNN because the training time is short.
* Also,CNN is used since it performs best in finding out the spatial correlations between the data.
* The Stock used for training is **Microsoft** since its market cap is over **1.58 trillion**
* After training we test our model on **NYSE** and on **Apple** stocks.
*The Evaluation metric is **Mean Absolute Percentage Error** (MAPE)
